CertificateSleuth
=================

This utility is useful for searching an LDAP Directory for users that have valid PKI certificates and adding their public encryption certificate to your keychain for authoring PKI-encrypted email.

This application was written as a replacement for CertificateFinder. The original source code of CertificateFinder 1.0, as provided by R. Matthew Emerson was used for reference when writing this application from scratch using modern Objective-C and updated API from the latest available version of Mac OS X.
